This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations.  The issue arises when attempting to access certain camera features, such as `zoom` or `flashMode`, before the camera has fully initialized.  This leads to unexpected behavior, such as the features not responding or causing the app to crash. The problem is exacerbated when combined with asynchronous operations and state management, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact moment of failure.
