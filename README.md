# Expo Camera API Asynchronous Initialization Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with custom configurations and asynchronous operations.  Accessing camera features (like zoom or flash) before the camera is fully initialized can result in unpredictable behavior, including crashes and unresponsive features.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, highlighting the attempt to access camera features prematurely.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version that ensures proper initialization and asynchronous handling, preventing these issues.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Interact with the camera features; observe the unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves using asynchronous programming techniques to ensure all camera features are accessible only after the camera component has fully mounted and initialized.  The code is corrected within `bugSolution.js`.
